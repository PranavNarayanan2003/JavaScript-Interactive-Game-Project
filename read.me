2D Cyber-Adventure Platformer
A dynamic side-scrolling platformer game built with p5.js and p5.sound. This project demonstrates core game design principles including collision detection, state management, procedural environment rendering, and object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

🎮 Game Features
Advanced Movement: Smooth character physics featuring jumping and a double-jump mechanic.

Dynamic Environments: Multi-layered backgrounds with gradient skies, 3D-effect mountains, trees, and canyons.

Level System: Progress through multiple levels by reaching portals (Checkpoints).

Combat & Hazards: Face off against patrolling Enemy Robots that shoot lasers and dodge falling bombs.

Collectibles & Progression: Gather coins to increase your score and find hidden hearts to gain extra lives.

Immersive Audio: Integrated sound effects for jumping, collecting items, environmental rain, and game states (level up, game over, victory).

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this game locally, you just need a modern web browser. The project uses:

p5.js (v0.7.2)

p5.sound.js

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project folder:

Bash
cd your-repo-name
Run the game:
Simply open index.html in any web browser.

🛠️ Controls
A: Move Left

D: Move Right

W: Jump (Press twice for Double Jump)

Spacebar: Restart Game (when Game Over)

🏗️ Project Structure
The codebase is modularized to separate concerns:

sketch.js: The main entry point; handles the game loop (setup and draw), global state, and camera logic.

character.js: Manages the player character's rendering, movement physics, and input handling.

enemies.js: Contains the EnemyRobot class and logic for bombs and laser collisions.

environment.js: Handles the rendering of the game world, including mountains, clouds, and the portal system.

platforms.js: Implements a Factory Pattern to manage and detect collisions with traversable platforms.

collectables.js: Manages coins and extra-life hearts.

UI.js: Handles the Heads-Up Display (HUD) for scores, lives, and game-over screens.

🧪 Technical Highlights
Factory Pattern: Used in platforms.js to efficiently create and manage multiple platform instances.

Camera System: Implemented using p5 push(), pop(), and translate() to create a scrolling effect that follows the player.

Collision Physics: Custom logic for platform contact, canyon falling, and bounding-box detection for enemies.
